# 🛡️ Red Team Engineering Path: C & Low-Level Internals

> *"To break the system, you must first understand how the system is built."*

## 🎯 Mission

I'm building toward becoming a **Red Team Engineer**. This repository documents my journey from C fundamentals to building custom offensive security tooling.

**End Goal:** Build my own **Command & Control (C2) framework** and security tools from scratch—no frameworks, no abstractions, just raw C.

## 🧠 The Approach

1. **Learn C deeply** — Not just syntax, but memory management, pointers, and how things work under the hood
2. **Master network programming** — Sockets, protocols, client/server architecture
3. **Build projects** — Apply knowledge immediately through hands-on coding
4. **Get certified** — Validate skills with industry certifications (eJPT → CRTP → OSCP)
5. **Specialize** — Malware development, Windows internals, cloud security

## 📂 Repository Structure

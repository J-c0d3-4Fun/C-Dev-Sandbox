# 🛡️ Red Team Engineering Path: C & Low-Level Internals

> *"To break the system, you must first understand how the system is built."*

## 🎯 Mission

I'm building toward becoming a **Red Team Engineer**. This repository documents my journey from C fundamentals to building custom offensive security tooling.

**End Goal:** Build my own **Command & Control (C2) framework** and security tools from scratch—no frameworks, no abstractions, just raw C.

## 🧠 The Approach

1. **Learn C deeply** — Not just syntax, but memory management, pointers, and how things work under the hood
2. **Master network programming** — Sockets, protocols, client/server architecture
3. **Build projects** — Apply knowledge immediately through hands-on coding
4. **Get certified** — Validate skills with industry certifications (eJPT → CRTP → OSCP)
5. **Specialize** — Malware development, Windows internals, cloud security

## 📂 Repository Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| **[`/loot`](loot/)** | 🏆 **Projects & Tools** — Working code that demonstrates skill progression |
| **[`/learning`](learning/)** | 📖 **Study Materials** — Notes, exercises, and educational resources organized by topic |

## 🚀 Current Focus (Phase 4)

- **[CRTP (Certified Red Team Professional)](https://www.alteredsecurity.com/adlab)** — Active Directory attacks, Windows exploitation, lateral movement
- **[CARTS (AWS Cloud Red Team Specialist)](https://cyberwarfare.live/product/aws-cloud-red-team-specialist-carts/)** — Cloud security & AWS red teaming

## 📈 Progress Tracker

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Phase 1 | C Foundations (syntax, data structures, file I/O) | ✅ Completed |
| Phase 2 | Memory & Pointers (malloc, structs, pointer arithmetic) | ✅ Completed |
| Phase 3 | Network Programming & eJPT | ✅ Completed |
| Phase 4 | Windows & AD Deep Dive (CRTP) | 🟡 In Progress |
| Phase 5 | Malware Development (Sektor7, Maldev Academy) | ⚪ Planned |
| Phase 6 | C2 Framework Development | ⚪ Planned |

## 💻 Quick Start

```bash
# Compile any C file
clang filename.c -o output_name

# Run
./output_name
```

## Learning Progression

1. **C Fundamentals** → Data types, control flow, functions, I/O
2. **Memory & Pointers** → Malloc, structs, pointer arithmetic, function pointers
3. **File I/O & Streams** → Reading/writing files, binary data handling
4. **Network Programming** → Sockets, TCP/UDP, IP addresses, byte order
5. **Hands-On Projects** → Build simple tools using these concepts

## Topics Covered

- Strings and string manipulation
- Dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `realloc`, `free`)
- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Structures and unions
- Function pointers and callbacks
- File I/O (text and binary)
- Type qualifiers and storage classes
- Preprocessor directives and macros
- Socket programming (stream and datagram)
- Network byte order and address conversion
- Multi-file project organization
